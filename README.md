# Tiff

Tiff is a typeface diff tool that visually contrasts the differences between two 
fonts. I had the idea of creating such a tool to help me compare two fonts while
learning about typography.

The app is currently running at [http://tiff.herokuapp.com](http://tiff.herokuapp.com)

### Fonts

At this point, [Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts) serves as the only
source of external fonts for Tiff. However, I'm working on including more font
sources.

### Browser Support

Since the app uses some features only available in HTML5 and CSS3, use recent versions of 
modern web browsers for maximum compatibility.

### Credits
Thanks to my friends Michael Choi and Riobard Zhan for offering generous advice.

Thanks to Mark Brown (@markbrown4) for the font aligning code.
